R Analysis Outline for BIOL7263 Project

Analyses of geographic distance and genetic distance from Illumina ddradseq data processed in STACKS

A correlation analysis - Mantel's test
A spatial autocorrelation analysis - Moran's I
A visualization of the distribution - Genetic Distance Distribution Analysis

---
Outline of steps to take
- Read and Prepare Data:
  - use vcfR to extract data from "populations.snps.vcf" (STACKS - populations output)
    - best genetic distance to use?
  - use readxl to read geographic coordinates from an Excel file.
  - use geosphere to compute geographic distances from geo. cords

- Moran's I 
  - use spdep to determine if spatial autocorrelation exists
  - Ho: no spatial autocorrelation present. 
    - Expect spatial autocorr. because cliff swallows cluster around water 

- Mantel Test
  - use vegan to determine if correlation exists between genetic and geographic distances
  - Ho: No isolation by distance
    - Expect no isolation by distance as wasn't present with mitochondrial analysis & Fst suggests panmixia

- Genetic Distance Distribution Analysis:
  - use ggplot2 to plot genetic distance vs. geographic distance
  - Colonies isolated geographically and those not used in a year may have reduced gene flow
    - I'd like to plot Fis as well as
